Features
========

Omniport prides itself on its impressive and rich feature set. This includes the
following non-exhaustive list.

Code quality
------------

- **Idiomatic Python and Django**

  The entire codebase is written keeping in mind all the philosophies of 
  Python and Django, class-based views and all.

- **PEP8 compliant**
    
  All the postulates of PEP8 have been satisfied, from the sane rules to the 
  preposterous 80 character limit.

- **Completely documented**
    
  Even the most basic and obvious functions and classes have been documented 
  amply, as this documentation testifies.

Cutting-edge
------------

- **Modern technological stack**

  A consistent JSON API by Django REST framework on the backend powers a 
  single-page React application on the frontend.

- **Cutting-edge technology**

  Hope the devs are OK with bleeding because Omniport rolls with the latest 
  in technology as evident from the stack.

- **Containers**

  Docker containers ensure an easy set up and also the peace of mind that 
  there will never be surprises in production.

Ideals
------

- **Flexibility**

  The entire project consists of mix-and-match, plug-and-play, 
  load-and-forget components that work independently but better together.

- **Power**

  Almost any and every feature that you could possibly think of, and then 
  some, have been baked in and well integrated.

- **Minimalism**

  The entire project is very minimal and is totally devoid of bloat or 
  unwanted software. We call it lean.

- **Simplicity**

  Almost the entire project can be configured via external YAML and ENV files
  without touching a single line of code.

Open-source
-----------

Omniport is a product of, runs on, and therefore is, open-source. All aspects 
of Omniport, *including this documentation for some reason*, are licensed under 
the GNU GPLv3 license.
