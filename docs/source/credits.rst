Omniport is a team-effort. The sheer size of the project means that no one 
person is capable of creating, maintaining or upgrading the project. That said,
some people deserve credit for their exceptional contributions towards the
project. These are mentioned below.

Docker
------

The Dockerised distribution was made possible by Dhruv Bhanushali (dhruvkb_) 
with intermittent help of Pranjal Tale (pranjaltale16_).

Backend core
------------

The backend was developed and Dockerised by Dhruv Bhanushali (dhruvkb_) with 
the idea of swappable models incepted by Rohith Asrk (rohithasrk_).

Frontend core
-------------

The frontend core was developed by Mohit Virli (mohitvirli_), and then 
prepped for deployment by Praduman Goyal (pradumangoyal_). It was Dockerised by 
Dhruv Bhanushali (dhruvkb_).

Documentation
-------------

This documentation was written by Praduman Goyal (pradumangoyal_) and Dhruv
Bhanushali (dhruvkb_), the latter being the editor as well.

Services
--------

The full set of services for Omniport were developed by Dhruv Bhanushali 
(dhruvkb_) on the backend and Praduman Goyal (pradumangoyal_) on the frontend.

Apps
----

The entire team of the Information Management Group worked on developing apps
for Omniport. They can be found on GitHub (IMGIITRoorkee_) and on our website_.

Orchestra
---------

Like we said earlier, the orchestra deserves a fair share of credit.
