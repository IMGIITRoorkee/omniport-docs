Omniport provides a huge ocean of ready-to-use components and functions and 
classes. It's natural to feel lost every once in a while. And when you are lost, 
references are what will guide you from one built-in feature to the next.

These features of Omniport that are intended to make lives of developers' easier
have been documented here. The documents here are not meant for sysadmins or 
users of the software but rather explain, in painful detail, the various aspects
of Omniport that developers would want to incorporate into their apps.

.. warning::

  These guides are *volatile* and are *bound to change* as we update Omniport. 

  The nature of Omniport's rolling-release development cycle prevents us from 
  versioning these documents.
