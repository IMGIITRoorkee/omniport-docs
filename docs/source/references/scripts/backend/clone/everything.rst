Everything
==========

This script clones all the necessary services, as well as the shell for IIT
Roorkee (with the developer's consent), in their appropriate directories in the
``omniport-backend`` repository.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: console

  [dev omniport-backend]$ ./scripts/clone/everything.sh

You will be asked if you wish to install the IIT Roorkee shell. You can approve
the installation with :kbd:`Y` if you are an IIT Roorkee resident or otherwise
wish to experience the customisation Omniport allows. You can deny this
installation with any other key, primarily :kbd:`N`.
