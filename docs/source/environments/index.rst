Environments
============

The Omniport project has been designed keeping both development and production
environments in mind. Although the terms might be generic enough for every
single team in the world to have both of them, every single team implements
these two workflows in a very unique way. 

The Omniport Docker project is highly opinionated on both of these workflows,
which means that the out-of-the-box defaults might very likely not be what you
expect or want.

.. note::

  If you are a lone-wolf developer, the default production workflow, albeit with
  debugging enabled, is more likely to suit you rather than the default
  development one.

Read on to understand what Omniport's assumption of your workflows looks like.
