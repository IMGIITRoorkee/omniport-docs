Setting up
==========

Getting started with Omniport is easy, especially when going with the Docker
route. There are a few steps that are common to both enviroments after which 
the two flows diverge a bit. Effectively, thanks to Docker and some smart 
development, we are able to reuse the same code and containers, with minuscule 
changes, on development and production machines.

We'll try to comprehensively cover all scenarios but know that we will have to
restrict ourselves to the two out-of-the-box flows only.

Read on to understand how you can set up Omniport Docker on your own computers,
development servers and production servers.
