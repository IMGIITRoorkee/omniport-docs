Developer terms of use 
======================

Preamble 
--------

These Omniport developer terms of use (the "developer terms") are between the
Information Managment Group ("IMG"), the individual or organisation managing the
installation of Omniport in a given institution (the "local instance
maintainers") and the individual or organisation (the "developer") agreeing to
these terms.

These terms govern the developer's access to and usage of services and products
provided by IMG including APIs, SDKs, scripts, tokens, sessions, data,
information and documentation (the "platform").

By choosing to use one or more of the platform's features in your application
(the "app"), the developer agrees to be bound to these terms as a developer. If
the developer uses the platform on behalf of another individual or organisation,
the developer must have the authority to bind that entity to these terms,
otherwise cease the use of the platform and its features entirely.

OAuth2 applications
-------------------

Use of the platform
+++++++++++++++++++

The developer will comply with all Omniport policies. The maintainers of the
running instance of Omniport will, at their discretion, approve or deny any
application submitted for review.

Prohibited actions
++++++++++++++++++

The developer warrants that it will not (attempt to)

- violate, encourage or facilitate the violation of Omniport's acceptable use
  policy.
- use or alter the portal, or any element thereof without explicit consent from
  the maintainers.
- mislead users to collect, alter, use or delete user data without the explicit
  consent of the user.

Platform usage
++++++++++++++

The maintainers in their infinite wisdom, may, in their own discretion, choose
to

- review and monitor the platform including detailed analytics of various
  sections of the platform, but are not obligated to do so. Omniport is not
  responsible for data and content accessible via the platform.
- restrict any developer's use of the platform. The developer may reach out to
  the maintainers in case the restrictions are not fair. However the developer is
  not to circumvent these restrictions.
- issue updates to the platform from time to time, not all of which will be
  backwards compatible. Any applications using the API endpoints may need to be
  reworked.

Open-source
+++++++++++

The platform and all of its services are open-source. The source code of these
are accessible online. However there are a few components and apps of the
platform that are not open-source and will never be. The developer must respect
the licenses of all of these components.

Security
--------

To the extent the developer possesses or has access to any token issued by the
platform, the developer must

- prevent loss, theft, damage or unauthorised access to any bit of user data and
  tokens using no less than the industry standard security measures.
- maintain a comprehensive security program based on reasonable organizational,
  physical, and technical security controls.
- use secure communication protocols such as SSL or TLS and Hypertext Transfer
  Protocol Secure (HTTPS) enabled by default for any data that is transmitted to
  and from the platform.
- promptly report to the maintainer any known or suspected security breach
  involving the platform and provide reasonable assistance to the maintainers to
  patch the breach. n the event of a security breach, prior to issuing any public
  statements or responses to third party inquiries, the developer will work in
  good faith with the maintainers to coordinate a statement or response, unless
  prohibited by law.
- require the user to be authenticated via the OAuth2 flow before accessing the
  data.
- not copy, use, or store any login credentials (including name, email address,
  password, and access tokens) except as necessary in connection with the initial
  user authentication; provided that developer will only store login credentials
  within the app and will promptly delete login credentials once the user has
  completed the initial authentication.
- not collect any login credentials from or allow users to input any login
  credentials into any user interface other than the platform login page, as
  described in the documentation.
- not impersonate the Omniport login page in any way, not use a custom login
  page as a proxy or use a layout or design anywhere on your site that may lead
  the user to believe they are on the platform.

User data
---------

The developer must

- ensure that data is collected, used, processed, transmitted and maintained in
  compliance with a privacy policy that is made available to users and that
  clearly and accurately describes the data that is collected and how it is used
  by the developer and by any third party that is privy to this information or any
  additional information generated from it.
- notify the users of its responsibility in maintaining the privacy, security
  and integrity of the data that is collected or accessed by the developer.
- never override the users' instructions, preferences or authorisations in the
  use or disclosure of their data.

Other platforms and users
-------------------------

The developer is responsible for

- respecting the terms and conditions for all the platforms and operating
  systems on which the app is distributed and used.
- ensuring that all queries, complaints and feedback of the users pertaining to
  the app is addressed by the developer and is not targeted or redirected to the
  maintainers.
- making it clear that the app, although integrated with the platform is not a
  part of it and that the maintainers do not, in any way, endorse or condone any
  action undertaken by the app or the developer.

Intellectual property
---------------------

Omniport trademark license
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The maintainers grant the developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicenseable, revocable license to use the Omniport marks solely to
promote the app, provided that developer may not imply that the maintainers
created, support, or endorse the app in any way pertaining to `Other 
platforms and users`_.

This license is subject to these terms, applicable law, and the Omniport
branding guide. All goodwill derived from the developer’s use of the Omniport
marks will inure to the sole benefit of the platform.

The developer also agrees not to contest or aid in contesting IMG's rights in,
or the validity of, the Omniport marks.

Developer trademark license
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The developer must grant to the maintainers a non- exclusive, non-transferable
license to use the app marks and descriptive materials that developer publishes
about the app or the developer's use of the platform. This license is limited to
the maintainers promoting their products or services and acknowledging or
promoting developer's use of the platform.

The license is subject to applicable law and any trademark usage guidelines that
the developer provides to the maintainers, except to the extent the trademark
usage guidelines require further permission for the uses described above or
conflict with these terms.

Reservation of rights
+++++++++++++++++++++

Omniport reserves all right, title and interest in the marks pertaining to the
platform. Equivalently the developer reserves all right, title and interest
pertaining to the app.

Except as explicitly set forth herein, the terms do not grant anyone any right
in another entity's marks or other intellectual property.

Confidentiality
---------------

The maintainers and the developer may disclose confidential information to each
other. The receiving party may use the disclosing party’s confidential
information only to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under these
terms.

The receiving party must use a reasonable degree of care to protect confidential
information. The receiving party will not disclose confidential information to
any third party except to its employees, agents, or third party contractors who
need to know it and if they are bound by terms at least as restrictive as those
in these terms.

Confidentiality obligations do not apply to the extent the information

- was known to the receiving party without restriction before receipt from the
  disclosing party
- is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party
- is rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without a
  duty of confidentiality
- is independently developed by the receiving party without access to
  Confidential Information.
- A party may disclose confidential information to the extent it is compelled to
  do so by law if it provides reasonable prior notice to the other party, unless a
  court orders that the other party not be given notice. Upon written request, the
  receiving party will promptly return all confidential information and copies to
  the receiving party, or certify in writing that it has destroyed all such
  materials. Breach of this section could cause the disclosing party irreparable
  harm, and the disclosing party may seek immediate equitable relief, in addition
  to other rights and remedies it may have.

Termination
-----------

These terms will remain in force unless terminated as stipulated in the
subsections below.

Termination by IMG
++++++++++++++++++

IMG may terminate these terms or suspend developer’s access to all or any part
of the platform

- if the developer is in material breach of these terms and fails to cure that
  breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice.
- if IMG is required to do so by the law of the land or by ethical and moral
  principles.
- if ING ceases to offer any products or services covered by these terms.
- if IMG determines or has reason to believe the developer or the app may cause
  harm or loss to the platforn or to any of the platform's users, or the developer
  or the app is or will be a threat to to the platforn or to any of the platform's
  users.
- for any other reason with 30 days prior written notice to the developer.
- in order to assess or address any imminent or potential security threat.

Termination by the developer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The developer may terminate these yerms at any time by ceasing all use of the
platform (including use by the apps) and by either

- deleting the app if the developer is the sole developer.
- leaving the team if there are others on the app team.
- Leaving the app running without any active member left on the team does not
  constitute termination on part of the developer because the app will still be
  active and will be under the responsibility of the developer.

Effect of termination
+++++++++++++++++++++

If these terms are terminated

- the rights granted by IMG to the developer will cease immediately.
- the developer will cease all use, operation, support, promotion, and
  distribution of the the app and the platform.
- the developer may lose all access to any content, material or information that
  the developer has provided to IMG regarding the app or the platform.


The following terms will survive the termination of the agreement

- `Prohibited actions`_
- `Platform usage`_
- `User data`_
- `Intellectual property`_ - `Definitions`_

Warranties
----------

The developer represents and warrants that

- all information that the developer provides to the maintainers is true,
  accurate and complete.
- the developer has the full right, power and authority to make, distribute and
  operate the app, use the platform and to enter into these terms.
- the developer, the app, its use and its use of the platform will not violate
  the intellectual property rights, or other rights of others, or violate any
  laws.

Indemnity
---------

The developer will indemnify, defend and hold Dropbox and its affiliates
harmless from all costs and expenses arising from any third party claim relating
to any breach or omission on the developer's part in upholding these terms.

Disclaimer
----------

THE OMNIPORT SERVICE, PLATFORM AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN
RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. IMG AND THE
LOCAL INSTANCE MAINTAINERS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of liability
-----------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OMNIPORT, IMG, THE
LOCAL INSTANCE MAINTAINERS, THEIR AFFILIATES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR

ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
(INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, USE, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL
THEORY. LOSS OF DATA, USE, BUSINESS OR PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR
INDIRECT) EVEN IF IMG AND THE LOCAL INSTANCE MAINTAINERS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ALL AFOREMENTIONED PARTIES
WILL NOT EXCEED 0 (ZERO, ZILCH, NADA, NIL) IN THE CURRENCY OF YOUR CHOICE.

Modification
----------------

IMG may revise these terms from time to time. If, in the maintainers' sole
discretion, a revision is material, they will notify the developer by emailing
the email address associated with the developer's account. In the event of a
material revision, if developer does not agree to the revised terms, it may
terminate the terms within 30 days of receiving notice of the revision. If a
revision is not material, the maintainers will post the revised terms on its
website, and the developer is responsible for checking these postings regularly.
By continuing to access or use the platform after revisions become effective,
developer agrees to be bound by the revised terms.

Disputes
--------

None of the parties on the side on IMG including, but not limited to,
affiliates, agents and local instance maintainers will ever indulge a dispute
unless explicitly expressing an intention to do so which has about the same
chance as a snowball in hell given that IMG is a student organisation running an
awesome non-profit project to make every college on a planet a
technology-enhanced place.

Miscellaneous
-------------

These developer terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between the
developer and IMG with respect to the platform, and supersede and replace any
prior or contemporary agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to the
platform. These terms do not create third-party beneficiary rights. IMG's
failure to ensure a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.

IMG and the developer are not partners, affiliates or agents but the
relationship is deemed to be that of independent contractors.

Notices to IMG are to be sent via email, courier or mail and are deemed given
when received. Notices to the developer are to be sent via email, courier or
mail are and deemed given when sent.
