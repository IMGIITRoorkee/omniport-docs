We don't really understand how license cascading works but we sure do hope that
Omniport does not violate the licenses of any of its dependencies. All 
dependencies of Omniport retain their individual licenses and Omniport does not
in any way overrule the licensing of any of its dependencies, or dependencies 
thereof.

If you get how licensing and the cascading of licensing works, feel free to get
in touch. If Omniport is in violation of any terms of its dependencies'
licenses, please bring this to our notice. We'll be happy to resolve it.
