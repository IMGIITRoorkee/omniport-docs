Clear spacing
+++++++++++++

To maintain logo sovereignty, we require the logo to have a minimum spacing 
of ``1em`` on all sides at height of ``3.5em`` around it.

Size
++++

To maintain logo legibility the logo should never be scaled lower than 
``1.75em``. This may vary but you have to use your sensibilities.

Proportions
+++++++++++

The logo must always be scaled so as to maintain the proportions and aspect 
ratio. That's usually achieved by using the ``Shift`` key.

Background
++++++++++

The logo must always be used on a background where it can stand out. Extremely
detailed and colourful backgrounds are not recommended. Only in the cases where
your background has a palette similar to the logo, you are to use our grayscale
variant.

Alterations
+++++++++++

You are not to alter the logo in terms of color, shape, shadows, borders, 
typeface or tilt. Our designers put a lot of love into it. Respect that.
