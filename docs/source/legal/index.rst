=====

The use of Omniport as a user, a developer and/or as a local instance maintainer
is bound by a number of rules. This section is devoted to explicitly outlining
these terms.

Do note that above and beyond all these rules is a rule of ethics that we are 
all bound by as developers, sharing code and knowledge in the fair market that
is open-source.
