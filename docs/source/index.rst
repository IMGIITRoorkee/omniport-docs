philosophy and its features. It explains the technologies involved in the 
project and the ways in which this project can make your institute more 
technologically equipped than it is.

It also explains how yo can pitch in and support its continued development and 
upgradation. It explains how you can contribute code, design, documentation, 
buzz or traffic to the project.

Lastly but most importantly, it explains what it can do for you and what you can
